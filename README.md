# imagetohex
Converts an image into raw hex data for use with [my List Movies project on Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/168707761/#player).
## Instructions
1. Find an image editor. The one I use is [Piskel](www.piskelapp.com), but any other pixel art program will do the trick.\
2. Make an animation that is 16 pixels wide and 9 pixels high. When you are done, export it as a spritesheet. **Note: The spritesheet MUST be 1 column wide. The image wil NOT work unless this condition is met. ALSO: Make sure to export it as a PNG file.**
3. Run the executable in this repository. A window will pop up with a text box and two buttons saying "Load..." and "Generate".
4. Load your spritesheet by pressing the "Load..." button and navigating to it.
5. Click "Generate". A bunch of hex data will pop up in the text box. You're done!
